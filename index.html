			<h2>PETE BROOK</h2>

			<p>Pete Brook is an independent writer, curator and educator focused on prisons, photos and power. In 2008, he founded the website Prison Photography to bring together his research and writing. Pete’s work—which seeks to unpack issues such as procedure, visibility, distribution and abuses of imagery as it emerges from the U.S. prison industrial complex—has been featured by The British Journal of Photography, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Vice, ACLU and more. Pete has curated half-a-dozen exhibitions, including Prison Obscura (2014-2016) which brought together images about mass incarceration created outside of the documentary tradition, and travelled to seven U.S. venues.

The monies are supporting 8-months of teaching at San Quentin State Prison, as a guest instructor with the Prison University Project, where Pete and his students are co-authoring an anthology of essays and co-designing a curriculum on the topic of prison photography. His writing has been published by Aperture, The Atlantic, ICP, Marshall Project, Medium, Time, Truthout and Wired.</p>
